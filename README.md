Hello Astronomers


I am a master's student in astronomy at the University of Chile. My research for my thesis focuses on PDLAs at a redshift between 2.5 and 3.5, particularly in relation to high ionization and photo-ionization using CLOUDY.

In addition, I am involved in the CHANCES-CGM project for 4MOST, where my role includes the selection of catalogs for upcoming observations.

On a personal note, I am interested in various aspects of astronomy, such as galaxy evolution, cosmology, astrobiology, among others.

I plan to regularly update and share the projects I have in mind and the programs that have assisted me throughout my studies.
